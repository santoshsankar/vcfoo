# What is Venture Capital?

#### ***Venture capital** is a form of private equity that's focused on financing enterprises in the earliest stages of their lifecycle in promise of earning a return from their high-growth potential.*

## The Private Equity Spectrum

Private equity encompasses a variety of strategies, but it is generally typified to fall into one of four categories when discussing corporate-focused investments:
* Seed/early stage
* Growth
* Buyout
* Distressed

Venture capital is generally considered to comprise seed/early stage through to growth stage financing. The similarity between categories is that they focus on corporate opportunities (vs ones in real estate or commodities) and operate in private markets.

## Private Markets

Private and public markets are important to distinguish between.
