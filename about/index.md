## The Tao


## Everyone's Best Builds Success

Everything here is the result of the work of many. The nature of investing is that there is never a right answer-- it all depends on the situation. It only makes sense at that point, that the thoughts and ideas here are the amalgamation of many.

## Colophon

Great typography can really foster a more pleasurable reading experience and we've taken the time to select fonts that are great on mobile or desktop.

### Lora

[Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) is a well-balanced contemporary serif text typeface with roots in calligraphy. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves counterposed with driving serifs.

The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay. Technically Lora is optimized for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.

### Raleway

[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) is an elegant sans-serif typeface family intended for headings and other large size usage. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
